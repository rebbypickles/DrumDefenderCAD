Reminders for github usage:
- Use branches to isolate parts from the main branch while they're still being worked on
- Merge branches to main to update the main branch with all the stuff you added
- When editing files, just change the file directly, no need to create new copies of the same files
    - Previous versions of the file will be saved!
- Update / backup often, that's what version control is for!
- You can add descriptions to your commits! It makes it easier to see what you've changed
